# Summary

This program is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors from top universities. All courses included in this program, originate from the world's top educational institutions in the field of computer science, such as Harvard, MIT, and University of Helsinki.

The curriculum is designed as follows:
- *Intro CS*: giving a basic but broad overview of the computer science spectrum.
- *Core CS*: classes that all computer science majors would be required to take
- *Advanced CS*: corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, taking electives according to the student's interests

All or nearly all course material is available for free. However, some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.
