# Summary

OPENCS is an open source computer science curriculum adapted from [Stefan Luiken's open source CS program](https://github.com/stefanluiken/my-open-source-cs) with all credits to him for personally crafting the curriculum. This program is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors from top universities. All courses included in this program, originate from the world's top educational institutions in the field of computer science, such as Harvard and University of Helsinki.

I decided to merge my ongoing learning with this curriculum so as to be able to track my learning and also to structure it appropiately. For context, in the previous 2 years, I had predominantly learnt Python and JavaScript. Before undertaking this OPENCS, I had also enrolled in a local diploma program in web and programming to solidify my application on Python and JavaScript (you can find my motivations [here](https://danialfaizsal.com/project-300-2022-mastery-based-learning/)).

The curriculum is designed as follows:
- *Intro CS*: giving a basic but broad overview of the computer science spectrum.
- *Core CS*: classes that all computer science majors would require to take.
- *Specialization CS*: a specialization in software engineering.
